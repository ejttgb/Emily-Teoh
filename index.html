  <h1>Oh look, you're Emily's website, welcome! </h1>
  <p>Here is a funny joke: </p>
  <p>Q: What do you call a wandering nun?</p>
  <p>A: A Romin' Catholic!</p>
  <p>Ok, now that I have amused you, here is the rest of my website. </p>

  <ul>This is an unordered list of websites I visit frequently:
      <li>Here is a link to<a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> so you can find stuff online</li>
      <li>And here's a <a href="template2.html">link to an xhtml template</a> in case you need that</li>
      <li>I also visit <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a> often, because music is good</li>
  </ul>

<p> And there's a picture of me, in case you wanted to know what I looked like leaning out of a moving train in Malaysia. If you want to know more about that, you can email me by clicking on the picture :)</p>

  <img src="profile.jpg" alt="A picture from when I stuck my head out of a moving train" title="Emily Teoh" width="100px"/>
  <!--Alternate text will show up if the picture doesn't load on viewer's screen, so make it descriptive-->
  <!--title tag on photos is the text that shows up when when people hover over the photo-->
  <!--Setting a width of a photo will automatically set a good height for you, but you can manipulate it on your own if you want-->
</a>
<!--Clicking on the photo will give you a mail to address; we need this for the class assignment-->
